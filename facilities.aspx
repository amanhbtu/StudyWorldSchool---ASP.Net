The Study World School Library has been refurbished and re-stocked in recent years and the school is committed to ongoing investment in print books and digital technology such as Kindles and other e-book sources and resources. There is ample space for research and reading on the ground floor, and plenty of access to IT facilities on the second floor. WiFi connection enables the boys to access their laptops within the building. The library has been designed to provide the boys with a quiet and purposeful atmosphere for study and intellectually creative thought.Boys are able to use the library throughout the term and there are regular book fairs and meetings of the Library Council attended by boys and masters to discuss the development of our library resources, such as book requests, Kindles, newspapers and periodical publications, and reference material. There are also departmental libraries to support the work and resources of the Kilachand Library. The library is also home to the Founders’ Room and the Archives, with a full-time archivist.
